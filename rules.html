			<center><h1><small>Rules</center></h2></small>
                        <center>Here are the rules for CollabVM. If you break any of them, expect a ban.
			<center><h2><small>R1. Don't violate the law.</center></h2></small>
                        <center>Do not use the VMs to violate United States federal law, New York state law, or international law. If CollabVM becomes aware of a crime that has been committed through its service, you will be immediately banned and your activity may be reported to the police if necessary.
						<br>CollabVM is required by law to notify law enforcement agencies if it becomes aware of the presence of child pornography on or being transmitted through its network.
						<br>(P.S: Basically every VPN service, both free and commercial, will forward your details to law enforcement if they are asked to, even if they claim to keep "no logs". Don't try it, buckaroo.)
			<center><h2><small>R2. No running DDoSing tools.</center></h2></small>
                        <center>Do not use CollabVM to DDoS an indivdiual, business, company, or anyone else.
			<center><h2><small>R3. No *coin miners.</center></h2></small>
                        <center>Do not mine any cryptocurrency using CollabVM</a>.

                        <center>Do not spam any emails using this service. 
			<center><h2><small>R5. Do not abuse any exploits.</center></h2></small>
                        <center>Do not abuse any exploits you find. Instead, report them to me at <a href="mailto:computernewbab@gmail.com">computernewbab@gmail.com</a>. NOTE: RATs, TeamViewer, and other tools do not count as "exploiting" or "cheating". 
			<center><h2><small>R6. Don't impersonate other users.</center></h2></small>
                        <center>Do not impersonate other members of CollabVM. If caught you'll be temporarily disconnected and banned if necessary.

                        <center>Do not use any methods to vote more than one time during a Vote for Reset. Only one vote per person is allowed, no matter what. Anybody who is caught doing this will be warned, then banned.
			<center><h2><small>R8. You're responsible for what you do on the VMs.</center></h2></small>
                        <center>CollabVM is considered a proxy service by law. By using this service, you agree that you acknowledge that everything you do on these virtual machines is logged, and you are OK with your IP Address, Username, and all actions done on the virtual machine being logged. You agree that you are responsible for any actions that you perform while you are using any of the virtual machines.
			<center><h1><small>Bot Rules</center></h2></small>
                        <center>These rules apply to all bots and automated scripts.
			<center><h2><small>R1. No performing destructive actions constantly.</center></h2></small>
                        <center>Any bot/automated script may not destroy the VM or render it unusable constantly. This includes bots that spam massive amounts of keyboard/mouse input. They are allowed to take turns and perform non-destructive actions, however.
			<center><h2><small>R2. No participating in vote resets.</center></h2></small>
                        <center>Any bot/automated script may not start or participate in vote resets. This includes commands which allow it to vote yes/no or start a vote reset.
			<center><h2><small>R3. No responding without user consent.</center></h2></small>
                        <center>A user must have to specify something, i.e. a direct message (@ChatBot), command prefix (e.g. +help), or something similar - bots/Automated scripts may not respond to every message.
			<center><h2><small>R4. Bots/Automated scripts must follow all user rules.</center></h2></small>
                        <center>Bots/Automated scripts must follow all rules above the Bot Rules in addition to these rules.<br>Bots/Automated scripts may have any command so long as it follows the above rules.
