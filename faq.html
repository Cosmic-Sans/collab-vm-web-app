<center><h1><small>Frequently Asked Questions</center></h2></small>
                  <center>Here are some frequently asked questions asked about CollabVM.
<center><h2><small>Q. What is CollabVM?</center></h2></small>
                  <center>A. CollabVM is a website that lets you control several virtualized machines via your web browser, for fun, testing, and overall entertainment.
<center><h2><small>Q. How do I use this website?</center></h2></small>
                  <center>A. Just click on the screen and wait for your turn. If there are no turns you will be given one automatically.
<center><h2><small>Q. The VM is really messed up, slow, or Windows will no longer start, now what?</center></h2></small>
                  <center>A. If the VM will no longer start or is really messed up, you should click the "Vote for Reset" button to vote for a reset. If it succeeds, this will reset the VM to a clean, non-messed up state. If the VM really needs a manual reset or the vote reset is broken email me at <a href="mailto:rightowner@gmail.com">rightowner@gmail.com</a>.
<center><h2><small>Q. Some names have a blue or yellow background color, what does that mean?</center></h2></small>
                  <center>A. A blue background color means that person is the one who is currently in control of the virtual machine. Anybody waiting for a turn will receive a yellow background color. If they have not requested a turn yet, they won't have any background color.
<center><h2><small>Q. Some names have a red, black, or gray-colored username, what does this mean?</center></h2></small>
                  <center>A. A red username means that user is an administrator. A black username means they are registered and logged in. Gray means they are not registered or not logged in.
<center><h2><small>Q. What happens if the computer is shut down?</center></h2></small>
                  <center>A. I have made it so turning off the computer is pretty hard. If it is bypassed however nothing happens, it just restarts even if "Shut Down" is clicked.
<center><h2><small>Q. Why won't CollabVM load for me? What's wrong?</center></h2></small>
                  <center>A. If it doesn't load, please make sure you do not have any of the following addons installed:<br><br>
      <b>NoScript</b><br><br>
      <b>uMatrix</b><br><br>
      <b>Ghostery is also known to affect some users of CollabVM</b><br><br>
      If you have any of these addons installed, make an exception for CollabVM in them and try connecting again.<br><br>
      If you don't have any of those add-ons installed, the servers may be down. Please contact me at computernewbab@gmail.com. <br><br>
      An unlikely sceneraio is that you may be banned from CollabVM. To test this, you can use a VPN/proxy to connect. (If you are banned, please do not use a VPN/Proxy to control the virtual machine unless you have my explicit permission. <b>Only do this to check if you are banned.</b>)<br><br>
      If you are banned, please contact me and we can see if we can sort it out.<br>
<center><h2><small>Q. What exactly is "off-limits"? Can I be banned? </center></h2></small>
                  <center>A. It is possible to be banned, although it's pretty difficult to do so. Read the <a href="http://computernewb.com/collab-vm/rules">rules</a> if you are concerned about them.
<center><h2><small>Q. It's asking me to login to the computer. What is the password?</center></h2></small>
                  <center>A. By default, there is no password on the computer, not on the Administrator account, nor the default "Dartz" account. If there is one, somebody put it there. If you cannot login just email me at <a href="mailto:computernewbab@gmail.com">computernewbab@gmail.com</a> and I'll fix it.
<center><h2><small>Q. Who coded and designed CollabVM?</center></h2></small>
                  <center>A. CollabVM was written by Cosmic Sans. The site was designed by Cosmic Sans and Dartz.
<center><h2><small>Q. It's stuck at a blank screen and on the top left it says "serial console" or "parallel console", help?</center></h2></small>
                  <center>A. Press CTRL + ALT + 1 to get out of it.
<center><h2><small>Q. The keyboard is stuck or is opening shortcuts, help?</center></h2></small>
                  <center>A. Press CTRL and ALT at the same time on your physical keyboard, this should unstick the keys. If Windows key is held down, press that as well. If that doesn't work try using the Keyboard button on the website to unstick the keys.
<center><h2><small>Q. Is it safe to view this at work, school, etc?</center></h2></small>
                  <center>A. Sometimes, sometimes not. If a VM has NSFW content prohibited it will be designated as "Safe for Work" (visible by clicking "Details" in the filter), however this does not stop anyone from opening something NSFW. It is best to not use CollabVM at your school or workplace.
<center><h2><small>Q. Will I break the VM if I go to http://computernewb.com/collab-vm/ on it?</center></h2></small>
                  <center>A. No, the VM will continue to operate perfectly fine, even if you request a turn, it will be fine (although the cursor will just stay there during its turn).
<center><h2><small>Q. How is this all hosted? </center></h2></small>
                  <center>A. This VM is hosted from a DataWagon server with 72 GB of RAM, using a fork of Guacamole and a custom server.
<center><h2><small>Q. Is the project open source?</center></h2></small>
                  <center>A. Yes, the source code for the server may be found <a href="https://github.com/cosmic-sans/collab-vm-server">here</a>.
